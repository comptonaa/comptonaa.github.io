<h1>Reflection</h1>

<p>
I started the Learning Technologies and Design program in spring 2018, pursuing an Educational Specialist degree. When I initially reviewed the courses in the program,
I knew this was the program I was looking for. It includes theory and methodology courses along with hands-on technology and software courses. I have been able to reinforce 
the theory and methodology I have used over the last few years, and I was able to review new information and application regarding these as well. I was looking for a program 
where I could build on my current experience and take me to a higher level. I was also looking for a program where I could learn and get experience with various methods, technology, 
and software that I had not used before. In addition to learning technologies and design, I have been able to get valuable information and practice in front-end analysis, research, 
and project management. I perform front-end analyses and project management in my current position, but I had never received formal training in the approaches and best practices for those. 
These courses in particular will be a major help to me in my current position. In addition to those, I have also been able to gain knowledge and experience with technology and 
software that I have been very interested in bringing to my current position and our institution. I was excited to be able to take web development as I am responsible for my 
department’s intranet and web pages, and trial and error can be very frustrating. This program gave me the opportunity (and permission to myself) to designate time to learning how 
to do that part of my job better. I had minimal experience with the Adobe CC software, but this program has allowed me to grow and learn more applications in that suite such as 
Audition, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere. I have also been very interested in virtual reality and augmented reality as methods for delivery content in online courses and 
exploring the requirements and learning curve for doing that. I was excited to see a course offered in VR-enabled learning instructional design, and it was possibly the most “fun” 
course I took in the program, though it was extremely challenging at the same time.
</p>

<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>
I have been able to apply what I have learned in each course to my current position throughout the program. At times, it was interesting how well the course I was taking fit 
directly with what I was working on that semester. For instance, I was involved in research for a project the same semester I took Research Methods in ISLT; I was preparing for 
an upcoming project the same semester I took Project Management; and I was working on updating our department website the same semester I took Web Design and Development. My 
immediate goal is to continuing using what I have learned in this program about methodologies, theory, and technologies to improve in my current position and to be able to offer 
more and better assistance to our faculty.
</p>

<p>
I have combined the EdS in Learning Technologies and Design with the User Experience & Usability graduate certificate. About halfway through the degree courses, I realized 
that these two dovetailed very nicely to allow me to pursue other positions in the future. My interest is in moving into a administrative leadership role in higher education 
or an organization where I can help build an online learning/training program using my past experience and everything that I have learned in these two programs. I have an interest 
in universal design for learning and the courses I have taken in the EdS and UX certificate programs will allow me take that interest and apply good methodology, best practices, 
and use the appropriate technologies in the process of improving or building an online program.
