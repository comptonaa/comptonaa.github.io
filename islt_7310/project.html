        <h2>Learning Technologies and Design Competencies</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Design and Development of Learning Systems - I am able to design and develop innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable learning technologies based on theory-grounded research.</li>
            <li>Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation - I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems</li>
            <li>Leadership & Social Responsibility - I developed competencies for socially responsible technology leadership.</li>

            <h2>The supporting projects for this website are:</h2> <br>
            <ul><li><b>Final project from Intro to Digital Media</b></li></ul>
            <p>The final project from Intro to Digital Media is a course portfolio. The project highlights four areas – digital images, audio, video, and the final 
                Google Site designed to house these. The digital image is a flyer, designed using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, that identifies and explains the 
                essential elements of an online course homepage. The audio project was created in Adobe Audition and coincides with the digital image as an audio tour 
                of the essential elements of an online course homepage. The video was created with Camtasia and provides a video walkthrough of the essentials of an 
                online course homepage using digital images as visual effects.
            </p>
            <ul><li><b>Final project from Designing Online Learning</b></li></ul>
            <p>Designing Online concentrated on creating meaningful outcomes for online learning and designing online lessons to support those outcomes. This was 
                accomplished using various software tools, learning activities, and assessments. The final project was a design challenge using Google Sites to create 
                instructional materials, learning activities, and assessments for applying Universal Design for Learning concepts and principles to course development. 
                The site walks the learner through the three major segments of UDL, includes learning activities for each segment, and assessments as it allows them 
                to read, understand, and apply the concepts.
            </p>
            <ul><li><b>Final project from Front End Analysis</b></li></ul>
            <p>The final project for Front End Analysis is an ASK system that was developed to help faculty understand how to prepare for a Quality Matters Peer Review 
                at St Charles Community College. This project was created using Google Sites. The outcomes of the ASK system are to understand the basics of a Quality Matters 
                rubric and its purpose, apply the standards in designing/re-designing their online, hybrid, and remote courses, and discover how they can become internal peer 
                reviewers at the institution. The ASK system is divided into three main segments and goes down three levels. 
            </p> 
            <ul><li><b>Final project from Intro to VR-enabled Instructional Design – Seminar in ISLT</b></li></ul>  
            <p>The final project for Intro to VR-enabled Instructional Design was to work with a group to design a cohesive learning space in virtual reality using OpenSim 
                as the platform. I worked in a group of three people to design the environment, classroom space, and instructional materials having to do with space travel. 
                The environment consisted of three learning spaces, connected via ports and walkways, appearing as mini planets on the surface of Mars. Each space provides 
                instruction in different areas of space travel, included interactive elements, and allowed users to experience all of this in a virtual reality environment. 
                Since OpenSim will not be available for this website, screen shots from that project will be used in lieu of a live VR environment.
