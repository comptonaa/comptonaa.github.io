    <h2>
    Educational Background and Interests
  </h2>

<p>
My initial career goal was to work in the music business. This combined two areas that I felt passionate about 
and was able to meld together by earning the Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a concentration in music 
business from Belmont University in Nashville, TN. After working in the music business for 15 years, I decided to 
make a career change and pursue another interest – teaching. Next, I earned a Master’s in Business Education at 
Middle Tennessee State University. Teaching eventually led me to St Charles Community College where I began in 2006 
as an associate professor, later a full professor, and now as Dean of Online and E-Learning in 2018.
 <br><br>Coming to St Charles Community College also allowed me to also be closer to family. I am a geek at heart 
 and enjoy working with new technology, watching movies, traveling, and spending time with my family which includes three dogs.
